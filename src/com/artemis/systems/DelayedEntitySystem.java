/**
 * The purpose of this class is to allow systems to execute at varying intervals.
 * 
 * An example system would be an ExpirationSystem, that deletes entities after a certain
 * lifetime. Instead of running a system that decrements a timeLeft value for each
 * entity, you can simply use this system to execute in a future at a time of the shortest
 * lived entity, and then reset the system to run at a time in a future at a time of the
 * shortest lived entity, etc.
 * 
 * Another example system would be an AnimationSystem. You know when you have to animate
 * a certain entity, e.g. in 300 milliseconds. So you can set the system to run in 300 ms.
 * to perform the animation.
 * 
 * This will save CPU cycles in some scenarios.
 * 
 * Make sure you detect all circumstances that change. E.g. if you create a new entity you
 * should find out if you need to run the system sooner than scheduled, or when deleting
 * a entity, maybe something changed and you need to recalculate when to run. Usually this
 * applies to when entities are created, deleted, changed.
 * 
 * This class offers public methods allowing external systems to use it.
